- ## Q. 
"Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*' where:

'?' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Example 1:

Input: s = ""aa"", p = ""a""
Output: false
Explanation: ""a"" does not match the entire string ""aa"".
Example 2:

Input: s = ""aa"", p = ""*""
Output: true
Explanation: '*' matches any sequence.
Example 3:

Input: s = ""cb"", p = ""?a""
Output: false
Explanation: '?' matches 'c', but the second letter is 'a', which does not match 'b'.
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length, p.length <= 2000
s contains only lowercase English letters.
p contains only lowercase English letters, '?' or '*'."
