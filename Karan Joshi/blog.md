Thoroughly understand the project requirements, specifications, and user stories to ensure that your testing aligns with the expected outcomes.

## 2 Test Planning:

Create a comprehensive test plan that outlines the scope, objectives, test cases, and schedule for testing.

## 3 Test Cases:

Develop clear and concise test cases that cover various scenarios, including positive and negative cases, edge cases, and regression test cases.

## 4 Traceability:

Maintain traceability between test cases and requirements or user stories. This helps ensure that all requirements are adequately tested.
